## NighSurveillance

- This repository contains the NighSurveillance dataset for the following paper：[When Pedestrian Detection Meets Nighttime Surveillance: A New Benchmark (IJCAI 2020)](https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2020/71). Pedestrian detection at nighttime is a challenging problem largely underrepresented in the literature, while it is crucial in surveillance applications. Current benchmarks are insufficient to bridge such a gap between autonomous driving and surveillance scenarios. NightSurveillance is designed to comprehensively cover the following challenging and benefit practical security applications.
